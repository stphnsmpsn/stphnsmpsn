# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! 

## ðŸ“– Iâ€™m currently learning:

* Rust

  It's been a great adventure so far and I must say that completing all of the challenges in the Rustlings project and taking the time to read the official Rust book have really helped jump start my learning. Coming from C/C++, learning Rust has been relatively straight forward. It offers a lot I love the trait system. I hope to soon write my first production service in Rust. 
  
* Distributed Systems

  I'm leading a huge project at work to redesign our cloud infrastructure and having a ton of fun with it! Learning to design hihgly available, fault tolerant, multi-tenant web services is new to me but was a challenge I was very eager to take on and is shaping up nicely. 
  
## âš¡ Fun facts and how I got into programming:

* I started programming when I was around 16 years old (over a decade ago... oof!)
  * I used to write mods for Counter Strike Source and wound up owning a few servers and playing competitively. This got me into creating websites (mostly Wordpress and bbPress) and playing with databases. I didn't realize I was 'programming' or that this could be a career. I was just having fun.
  * My first introduction to desktop programming as an advanced Computer Science course in Grade 12 where I achieved a 100% course average and won an award from DeltaWare for my achievement. 

* In the years following, I found myself programming a lot as a hobby or to automate repetetive tasks at work (I created a tool in VB.net *gross* to automate the setup of new computers and other less notable things) 

* I eventually returned to school to formalize my education and grow my professional network. There, I earned my Bachelor of Electrical and Computer Engineering but, more importantly, met many friends and industry contacts.
