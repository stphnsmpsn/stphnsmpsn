# Hi there üëã

Welcome to my GitHub! 

## üî≠ I am currently working on:

* Rust

  I first became interested in Rust in 2018 and have been lucky enough to have been using it as my primary programming language since July 2021. I love the trait system / borrow checker, the ecosystem, and the community. Rust makes it easy to 'Get Shit Done'‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and ship with confidence. 
  
* Distributed Systems

  I write highly available, fault tolerant, and performant web-scale applications (in Rust). 
    
## ‚ö° Other Tools and Technologies

In addition to what is mentioned here, I am also proficient in several other programming languages (C, C++, Java, Python, PHP), tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, MQTT, etc...), and data stores (MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, RocksDB, etc...) just to name a few üòÑ

## ü§ì Hobbies 

* Reading
* Home Labbing
* Secure, No-Cloud Home Automation 
* Guitar
* Golf

## ‚ö° Fun facts and how I got into programming:

* I started programming when I was around 16 years old (a decade and a half ago... oof!)
  * I used to write mods for Counter Strike Source and wound up owning a few servers and playing competitively. This got me into creating websites (mostly Wordpress and bbPress) and playing with databases. I didn't realize I was 'programming' or that this could be a career. I was just having fun.
  * My first introduction to desktop programming was an advanced Computer Science course in Grade 12 where I achieved a 100% course average and won an award from DeltaWare for my achievement. 

* In the years following high school I found myself programming a lot as a hobby or to automate repetitive tasks at work. As an example, when I was working as a technical services manager for a large retailer, I created a tool in VB.net to automate the setup of new computers. The program worked great and wound up being used in several stores across Canada, saving us tons of time. I never sought out compensation for creating this tool. I enjoyed taking a problem and solving it; to me, it was just another puzzle. 

* I eventually returned to school to formalize my education and grow my professional network. There, I earned my Bachelor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and, more importantly, met many friends and industry contacts.
